# Sales-Forecasting-Project

# Introduction

This project focuses on predicting future sales using historical data. Accurate sales forecasts help businesses optimize their inventory, plan marketing strategies, and improve financial decision-making.

## Tools and Techniques:
**Programming Language**: Python<br>
**Libraries**: Pandas,Numpy,Scikit-Learn,Statsmodel,Matplotlib,Seaborn<br>
**Modeling Techniques**:Linear Regression,Random Forest Regressor,XgBoost Regressor,Logistic Regressoer, Decision Tree Model etc<br>
**Data sources**:Train.csv - Access Million

## Project Workflow:
**Data Collection**: The data was sourced from Access Million Company.<br>
**Data Preprocessing**: 
Handling missing values<br>
Normalization and scaling<br>
Feature engineering(e.g. creating lag variables,moving averages)<br>
**Exploratory Data Analysis**:<br>
Identified trends,seasonality and outliers<br>
Visualized sales data over time<br>
**Modeling**:
Building and test multiple models including:<br>
Linear Regression<br>
ARIMA(AutoRegression Integrated Moving Average)<br>
Random Forest<br>
**Evaluation**:
Selected the model with the best performance based on metrics like RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) and MAE(Mean Absolute Error)<br>
Achieved an accuracy of 97.56%

## Result:
The final model provided accuracte forecasts,particularly effective in predicting valuable insights.
